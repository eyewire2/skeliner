    A skeleton off the pipeline has no loops — the MST guarantees a tree — so

    surface-supported pair is the usual way).  That assertion is the useful
    part: the loop it opens is a statement that **two of these edges cannot
    both be right**, and one of them is a join the MST made that it should
    not have.

    Which one is not guessed.  With a *mesh*, :func:`edge_support` says which
    tree edges have no surface behind them at all (``T∖G``), and such an edge
    lying **on the loop** is the tree claiming a connection the surface does
    not support while an alternative path exists.  That is the break point,

    fine, and carries radii belonging to the wrong surface.  This turns that
    into a loud failure.

    What is checked
    ---------------
    * ``node2verts[1:]`` are **pairwise disjoint**.
    * ``vert2node`` is exactly the inverse of ``node2verts``.

    Node 0 is exempt from disjointness.  Its "bin" is ``soma.verts``, assigned
    wholesale by the soma stitch, while neurites are binned over the *face*
    based arbor — and under the ≥2-of-3 rule a face with one soma vertex is an
    arbor face and still contains that vertex.  Boundary vertices therefore
    belong to both by construction, and ``vert2node`` gives them to the arbor
    node.  Coverage is not checked either: soma, organelle, discarded and
    pruned surface are all legitimately unowned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    skel
        A :class:`skeliner.Skeleton` instance.
    mesh
        When given, additionally report which bins are split into more than one
        connected patch of surface.  This is **reported, never failed**: the

    A skeleton's bins name vertex *ids* and nothing else, so the ids alone
    cannot say which mesh they belong to.  Paired with a **larger** unrelated
    mesh every id stays in range, bins resolve to real faces, and every answer
    downstream — the surface a node owns, which pairs the surface joins, what
    a repartition would do — is computed against the wrong cell and returned
    without complaint.  A *smaller* one merely raises ``IndexError``, which is
    the safer failure of the two.

    Two independent things are asked, and they answer differently:

    ``in range``
        Every id ``node2verts`` names exists in the mesh.  A **necessary**
        condition, checkable on any skeleton ever written, and the one that
        rules out the smaller-mesh crash.
    ``counts``
        ``meta["mesh"]`` against the loaded mesh, when the skeleton carries
        it.  Exact, and it survives the ``.obj`` / ``.ply`` round trip that
        moves coordinates in the ninth decimal — which is why this is counts
        and not a hash of the vertex array.

    Skeletons written before ``meta["mesh"]`` existed carry no counts, so
    ``ok`` is the most that can be said of them and ``verified`` stays
    *False*.  The two are kept apart deliberately: *nothing contradicts this*
    is a weaker claim than *this is the right mesh*, and collapsing them would
    present a legacy skeleton as confirmed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    skel
        A :class:`skeliner.Skeleton` instance.

        The mesh to test it against.

    Distance from an arbitrary point (or collection of points) to the skeleton.

    Parameters
    ----------
    skel
        :class:`skeliner.Skeleton` instance.
    point
        3-vector or array of shape (M, 3) giving query locations.
    point_unit
        Unit of the input coordinates and the returned distance. If ``None`` or
        identical to ``skel.meta['unit']``, no conversion is performed.
    k_nearest
        Number of nearest skeleton nodes considered when refining the distance
        against neighbouring edges (≥ 1). Ignored when a whitelist is provided.
    radius_metric
        Which column of ``skel.radii`` to use. Defaults to the recommended estimator.
        Only consulted when *mode* is ``'surface'``.
    mode
        ``'surface'`` (default) returns the distance to the radius-aware capsule
        envelope (values inside clamp to ``0``). ``'centerline'`` measures distance
        to the centreline alone.
    allowed_nodes
        Optional per-call whitelist of node IDs. When provided, distances are
        restricted to these node centres and to edges incident to any of these nodes.
    allowed_edges
        Optional per-call whitelist of edges (u,v). When provided, distances are
        refined only against these edges (u and v are also considered as centres).
        Edges are treated as undirected; order is ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    skel
        :class:`skeliner.Skeleton` instance.
    point
        3-vector or array of shape (M, 3) giving query locations.
    point_unit
        Unit of the input coordinates and the returned distance. If ``None`` or
        identical to ``skel.meta['unit']``, no conversion is performed.
    k_nearest
        Number of nearest skeleton nodes considered when refining the distance
        against neighbouring edges (≥ 1).
    radius_metric
        Which column of ``skel.radii`` to use. Defaults to the recommended estimator.
        Only consulted when *mode* is ``'surface'``.
    mode
        ``'surface'`` (default) returns the distance to the radius-aware capsule

        Minimum distance(s) in the same unit as *point_unit*. With

    r"""Identify *tip* nodes suspiciously close to the soma.

    A *tip* is a node with graph degree = 1 (i.e. a leaf) and **not** the soma
    itself.  A leaf *i* is flagged when

    1. Its Euclidean distance to the soma center is *small*::

           d\_euclid(i) \le near\_factor × max(soma.axes)

    2. Yet the shortest‑path length along the skeleton is *long*::

           d\_graph(i) / d\_euclid(i) \ge path\_ratio\_thresh

    Parameters
    ----------
    skel
        A fully‑constructed :class:`skeliner.Skeleton` instance.
    near_factor
        Multiplicative factor applied to the largest soma semi‑axis to set the
        *Euclidean* proximity threshold.
    path_ratio_thresh
        Minimum ratio between graph‑path length and straight‑line distance for
        a leaf to be considered suspicious.
    return_stats
        If *True*, a per‑node diagnostic dictionary is returned in addition to
        the sorted list of suspicious node IDs.

    the rest are *distal*.  This is the measurement
    :func:`suspicious_junctions` thresholds, kept separate because which
    thresholds are right is an open question and the raw numbers are what
    answers it.

    Linear in the number of nodes.  The naive form — delete a node, flood
    each arm, repeat — is O(N²) and visits billions of nodes on a 50k-node
    skeleton.  Rooting the tree at the soma makes the same decomposition a
    single post-order accumulation:

    ``sub[v]``
        cable strictly inside the subtree rooted at *v*.
    distal arm through child *c*
        ``sub[c] + len(i, c)``
    proximal arm

    which sums back to ``total`` exactly, so the arms partition the cable
    rather than merely sampling it.

    A disconnected skeleton is handled by rooting **each** component at its
    lowest node id; for the component holding the soma that is node 0, so the
    usual case is unchanged and the orphan components still get measured
    instead of raising.

    A segmentation merge fuses two unrelated neurites in the *mesh*, so the
    skeleton grows a junction welding two independent arbors together.  The
    result is still a valid tree — one root, ``E = N − 1``, connected,
    acyclic — so :func:`check_connectivity` and :func:`check_acyclicity`
    cannot see it.  What gives it away is the shape: a genuine bifurcation
    into two long arbors at a single high-degree point is rare, while a merge
    produces exactly that.

    A node is flagged when its degree is at least *min_degree* **and** at
    least *min_components* of its distal arms each carry at least
    *min_distal_cable* of cable.

    This **reports candidates and never clips**.  The rule is a heuristic
    with no validation behind it, and acting on it destroys real cable, so
    the cut is a human decision made against the mesh — the same split
    :mod:`skeliner.pre` draws between its ``find_*`` and ``remove_*``
    functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    skel
        A :class:`skeliner.Skeleton` instance.  Assumed acyclic — check with
        :func:`check_acyclicity` first, since ``post.graft(...,
        allow_cycle=True)`` can break that assumption.
    min_degree
        Minimum graph degree for a node to be considered at all.
    min_distal_cable
        How much cable a distal arm must carry to count as substantial,
        expressed in *cable_unit*.
    cable_unit
        Unit *min_distal_cable* is given in, converted into the skeleton's
        own unit via ``skel.meta["unit"]``.  Skeletons from
        :func:`~skeliner.skeletonize` are in nanometres by default, so a
        bare ``250`` in skeleton units would be 250 nm — smaller than a
        single node radius, which flags every junction.  Naming the unit
        makes that mistake unrepresentable.
    min_components
        How many distal arms must clear *min_distal_cable*.
    group_regions
        A merge flags a cluster of adjacent nodes rather than one.  When
        *True* each connected cluster of flagged nodes collapses to a single
        representative — the one whose second-largest distal arm is longest
        — turning an N-item review queue into a handful.
    return_stats
        When *True* also return the per-node measurements.  Stats cover
        **every node examined** (degree ≥ *min_degree*), flagged or not, so
        a threshold can be re-chosen from them without recomputing.

    Returns
    -------
    flagged
        ``list[int]`` – node ids, most suspicious first (by the second-largest

    Estimate the morphology volume, optionally restricted to an axis-aligned bbox.

    Robust union via voxelization inside the bbox: fills voxels that lie
    inside any edge frustum or the soma ellipsoid. Correctly handles
    branch overlaps and bbox clipping. Accuracy controlled by `voxel_size`
    (defaults to ~1/3 of a thin-branch radius, auto-scaled to keep the grid
    under ~60M voxels unless you pass voxel_size explicitly).

    Parameters
    ----------
    bbox
        None (whole neuron) or [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax] or (lo, hi).
    radius_metric
        Which `skel.radii[metric]` column to use; defaults to the
        choice from `skel.recommend_radius()`.
    voxel_size
        Edge length of voxels. If None, a size is chosen
        from radii and capped so the grid stays reasonably small.
    include_soma
        Whether to include the soma ellipsoid in the volume.
    return_details
        If True, returns (V, details_dict) with diagnostic info for debugging.

    Returns
    -------
    float or (float, dict)
        Estimated volume (in the cube of your skeleton units). If
        `return_details=True`, also returns a small diagnostics dict.

    Notes
    -----
    * 'frustum' is blazing-fast and good for whole-cell summaries. It trims
      soma overlap on edges but **does not** de-overlap at branch junctions.
    * 'voxel' is the accurate union (no double counting) and is recommended
      whenever `bbox` is used or precise union is important.
